**Purpose**: Showcase the gamified reward system with EEC credits and badges
**Interaction**:
- Interactive badge gallery with 3D hover effects
- Click badges to see requirements and progress
- Real-time EC counter with animated increments
- Achievement unlock animations with particle effects

### 3. Mentor-Mentee Matching Interface
**Purpose**: Demonstrate the mentorship system functionality
**Interaction**:
- Dynamic mentor availability status
- Skill-based matching algorithm visualization
- Rating and feedback system interface
- Real-time chat simulation between mentor and mentee

### 4. Project Forking Simulator
**Purpose**: Show how sub-projects can customize the learning experience
**Interaction**:

- **Accent**: Quantum Purple (#6366F1) - highlighting innovation and advanced cryptography
- **Neutral**: Cool Gray (#64748B) - providing balance and readability
- **Success**: Mint Green (#10B981) - for achievements and positive feedback
- **Warning**: Amber (#F59E0B) - for important notifications

### Typography
- **Display Font**: "Inter" - Modern, geometric sans-serif for headings and UI elements
- **Body Font**: "Inter" - Consistent typography system for optimal readability
- **Code Font**: "JetBrains Mono" - For technical content and code snippets

### Visual Hierarchy
- Large, bold headings that command attention
- Clear content sections with generous whitespace
- Strategic use of color to guide user attention
- Consistent spacing and alignment throughout

## Visual Effects & Animation

### Core Libraries Integration
1. **Anime.js** - Smooth micro-interactions and UI animations
2. **ECharts.js** - Interactive data visualizations for progress tracking
3. **p5.js** - Creative coding for network visualizations and particle effects
4. **Pixi.js** - High-performance graphics for gamification elements
5. **Splitting.js** - Advanced text animations and effects
6. **Typed.js** - Typewriter effects for dynamic content
7. **Splide.js** - Smooth carousels for content presentation
8. **Matter.js** - Physics-based interactions for engaging experiences

### Animation Strategy
